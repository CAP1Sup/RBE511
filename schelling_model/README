The code can be executed by running the "schelling" file in Matlab. All simulations are run.

It has no toolbox/add-on dependencies, but benefits from the Parallel Compute Toolbox. The Parallel Toolbox allows multiple simulations to run simultaneously.

All simulation snapshots will be deposited in a newly created "images" folder.

Thanks,
